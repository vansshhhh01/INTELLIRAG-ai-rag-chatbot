INTELLIRAG üß†‚ú®
INTELLIRAG is a definitive, industry-grade, multi-modal AI analyst. This project transforms unstructured information from any source into actionable intelligence via a persistent, secure, multi-user platform, serving as a true cognitive partner. It demonstrates a production-level, anti-fragile architecture that pushes the boundaries of modern AI applications.

üöÄ The Cognitive Core: Beyond Standard RAG                                       
At its heart lies a sophisticated Cognitive Core, a master agent that understands user intent. It intelligently routes queries to a team of specialist AI agents:

1) The Researcher: For deep contextual understanding of unstructured data from text, audio transcripts, and image descriptions.

2) The Data Scientist: An autonomous agent that writes and executes Python code to perform quantitative analysis on structured tables it finds within documents.

This is not just Retrieval-Augmented Generation; this is Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning.

üî• Key Features: The Power of The Beast                                                
INTELLIRAG is engineered with a suite of god-tier features that place it at the forefront of AI development.

Universal & Multi-Modal Ingestion                                       
Go beyond simple text. INTELLIRAG processes a vast array of sources, creating a truly holistic knowledge base for each user.

1) Documents: PDFs & TXT files

2) Media: Audio (MP3, WAV) & Images (PNG, JPG)

3) Video Intelligence: Full analysis of video files (MP4), transcribing speech and describing key visual frames.

4) Structured Data: Automatically identifies and extracts tables from PDFs into a Pandas DataFrame, ready for analysis.

Autonomous Analyst                                                         
Delegate high-level tasks. Ask INTELLIRAG to "analyze the marketing strategy," and it will:

1) Generate its own intelligent research plan.

2) Execute the plan by querying the knowledge base with its specialist agents.

3) Synthesize a comprehensive, multi-faceted report.

Persistent & Secure Memory                                                   
Powered by Google Firebase, INTELLIRAG is a true multi-tenant application.

1) Secure Authentication: Full login/signup system with robust password verification.

2) Isolated User Data: Each user's knowledge base and conversation history are stored in a secure, isolated Firestore database, preventing any data leakage.

3) Session Persistence: Log in from anywhere and pick up exactly where you left off.

Futuristic UI & Streaming                                                           
A stunning, professionally designed interface built for an unparalleled user experience.

1) Custom Aesthetics: A sleek, dark-themed UI with custom fonts and glowing, animated elements.

2) Real-time Streaming: All text-based AI responses are streamed word-by-word, creating a dynamic "typing" effect that feels alive and responsive.

3) Professional Workflow: A user dashboard provides a central hub for managing knowledge bases and initiating conversations.

‚ö° Quick Start                                                                      
This project is designed for rapid, one-click deployment in a cloud environment.          
Obtain API Keys:

1) Google Gemini API Key

2) Firebase Project Credentials (Service Account JSON & Web API Key)

Deploy:                                                                            
The entire application, including system setup and library installation, is contained within a single, all-in-one Google Colab script. Simply open the notebook, insert your keys, and run the master cell to launch the application.
